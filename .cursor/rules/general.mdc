- This is a repo that is organized using Hexagonal Architecture and Nix flakes.
- 'maskfile.md' provides convenient commands that are quick and easy to run.
- Use Nickel lang for complex configurations that need to be output to JSON/YAML/TOML files.
- Use nushell for better JSON manipulation and safer shell scripting.
